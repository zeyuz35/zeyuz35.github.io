PhD Candidate at Monash University, Depart of Econometrics and Business Statistics, supervised by Bonsoo Koo and Benjamin Wong.

My research interest lies in high dimensional factor models, structural breaks, and econometric theory for macroeconomics.

I am close to my submission date in late August, and will be on the job market for 2024/2025.
